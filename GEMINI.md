PROJECT CONTEXT
You are working on a simple, professional website for a real beauty business. This website is being created as part of a portfolio showcase and must look polished, trustworthy, and suitable for a new business that wants to attract clients online.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The business offers nail and beauty services. It specializes in gel nails, acrylic nails, nail extensions, manicures, pedicures, facials (skin care), waxing (hair removal), and eyelash extensions.
The business is based in South Africa at the following physical location:
Inanda, 3558 Curnick Ndlovu Highway, Inanda (Under the Moon).
The business is newly established, so the website should help create a strong first impression and make the business look professional and credible.
DESIGN DIRECTION
The client has given permission for the designer to take the lead on the design.
Preferred brand colours:
Green should be the dominant colour
Brown and cream should be used as supporting colours
The overall look and feel should be:
Clean
Elegant
Calm
Premium
Suitable for a beauty and nail studio
The client mentioned Kristen Marie as light inspiration in terms of overall feel and presentation, but the design should not copy colours or layouts directly.

SCOPE OF WEBSITE
This is a simple website with no booking system and no advanced functionality.
The website should:
Clearly present the services offered
Display the business location and contact details
Include a short “about the business” section
Use provided logo, images, and brand colours
Be mobile-friendly
Look professional and trustworthy

PORTFOLIO CONTEXT
This website will be used as a portfolio example. The business owner has agreed that the finished website may be featured as a case study once approved.

The model should prioritize clarity, simplicity, and visual polish over complexity.
